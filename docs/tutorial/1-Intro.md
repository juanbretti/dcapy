# Dcapy Tutorial - Introduction

This tutorial aims to show how to use **Dcapy** with most of its features. It follows a workflow built throught a Jupyter Notebook which can be replicated by the user. 

Each section gradually depends on the previous ones in order to build well defined workflows according with the needs.

## Sections 

This tutorial is devided in the next sections in order to explain all the modules included:

+ **Dca Module**: It contains the step-by-step instructions to build basic forecast using Arps and Wor (so far) methodologies. Introduces the main concepts to declare outputs and how the classes relates with each other. 

+ **Filters Module**: It contains the explination for the time series filters (Working on it!) used basically to fit external data to Arps and Wor models 

+ **Weiner Module**: It explain how to get simple random walks simulations including the Geometric Brownonian Motion to be used, for example, to model the oil prices probabilistically. 

+ **Models Module**: This section explains how to implement the *scheduling* and *cashflow* features to evaluate groups of forecast, scenarios and wells not only in production behavior but also their economics  indexes.
